# meme-trader-bot
Bot used to trade MEME Coins using KuCoins API.  I'm on version 3.7.1. I haven't been using any version control and then my laptop crashed and I lost the last three versions so I'm back to loading then up lol.  I don't know why I didn't from the start.  It's best practice but with LLMs the versions come so fast that I get caught up.
